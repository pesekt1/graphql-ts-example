# graphql-ts-example

This is the repository for the project built in [this tutorial](#) where I explained how to use GraphQL and TypeScript, and TypeGraphQL to build a GraphQL API.

## Running the app

To get started, you need to ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then follow the instructions below to get the app running locally:

- Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:dillionmegida/graphql-ts-example.git
  cd graphql-ts-example
  ```

- Install dependencies

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Run the app

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

When the development server is running, you can visit the GraphQL playground at [http://localhost:8000/graphql](http://localhost:8000/graphql) and query the APIs. It looks like this:
